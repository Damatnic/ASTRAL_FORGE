# 404 Route Errors Fixed - October 6, 2025

## Issue
Multiple routes were returning 404 errors because the route files didn't exist in the Next.js app directory structure.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. `/compete` - Competition Hub
**Error:** `compete?_rsc=1r3hv:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/compete/page.tsx`
- Competition hub with links to PVP, leaderboards, challenges, and guild wars
- Stats overview showing wins, rank, active challenges, and win streak
- Clean Xbox/PS5 aesthetic matching the redesign
- Coming soon notice for future features

### 2. `/workout/session` - Workout Session Tracker
**Error:** `workout/session?_rsc=1r3hv:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/workout/session/page.tsx`
- Workout session page with start/finish functionality
- Exercise list with add/remove capability
- Duration and exercise count tracking
- Quick actions floating toolbar
- Coming soon notice for full tracking features

### 3. `/programs/active` - Active Program View
**Error:** `programs/active?_rsc=16jaj:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/programs/active/page.tsx`
- Active program display page
- Empty state with "Browse Programs" CTA
- Program stats placeholder (week, sessions, progress)
- Clean card-based layout

### 4. `/programs/[id]` - Dynamic Program Details
**Errors:** 
- `programs/6?_rsc=16jaj:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/programs/[id]/page.tsx`
- Dynamic route for individual program details
- Uses Next.js 14 `useParams()` to get program ID
- Program info card with stats (duration, frequency, focus)
- "Start Program" CTA button
- Coming soon notice for detailed workout plans

### 5. `/history` - Workout History
**Error:** `history?_rsc=1mwxj:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/history/page.tsx`

- Clean layout ready for workout entries

### 6. `/progress/photos` - Progress Photos
**Error:** `progress/photos?_rsc=1mwxj:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`

**Solution:** Created `app/progress/photos/page.tsx`
- Progress photo tracking page
- Upload button in header
- Empty state with upload CTA
- Photo grid placeholder (2x3 on mobile, 3x4 on desktop)
- Tips section for taking consistent progress photos
