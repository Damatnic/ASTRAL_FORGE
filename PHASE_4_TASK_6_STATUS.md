**File Created:** `lib/milestone-system.ts` (~950 lines)

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces and types
- ✅ 6 milestone categories (strength, volume, consistency, technique, endurance, body-recomp)

- ✅ Requirement types (absolute-strength, relative-strength, volume, consistency, endurance, technique, body-recomp)
- ✅ MilestoneSystem class with static methods
- ✅ 55+ predefined milestones

**Milestone Breakdown:**
- **Strength:** 15 milestones (bench/squat/deadlift - absolute & relative)
- **Volume:** 5 milestones (100k → 10M kg total)
- **Consistency:** 9 milestones (streaks + total workouts)
- **Endurance:** 7 milestones (pull-ups, push-ups)
- **Technique:** 3 milestones (form certifications)

**Methods Created:**
- `generateMilestones(userStats)` - Create all milestones with progress
- `generateStrengthMilestones()` - Bench/squat/deadlift benchmarks
- `generateVolumeMilestones()` - Total volume achievements
- `generateConsistencyMilestones()` - Streaks and workout counts
- `generateEnduranceMilestones()` - Bodyweight rep goals
- `generateTechniqueMilestones()` - Form mastery badges
- `getNextMilestones()` - Suggest 3-5 nearest goals
- `getRecentlyEarned()` - Show latest achievements
- `getMilestonesByCategory()` - Filter by category
- `getMilestonesByTier()` - Filter by difficulty
- `getCompletionStats()` - Overall progress analytics

**Example Milestones:**
```typescript
