## 🎯 What's Next

### Immediate Priority
The goals page redesign code is ready but needs to be properly applied. We have two options:

**Option A: Complete Goals Page** (Recommended)
- Apply the new goals page design
- Test functionality
- Move to Progress page

**Option B: Skip to Other Pages**
- Leave goals page for later
- Start on /achievements or /progress
- Return to goals in Phase 3

### Remaining Work

**Phase 2 Continuation:**
- Goals page (ready to apply)
- Progress page (needs design)

**Phase 3 - Secondary Pages:**
- /achievements
- /guild  
- /compete
- /health
- /skills
- /settings

**Phase 4 - Cleanup:**
- Delete `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- Delete old navigation components
- Remove old page versions

**Phase 5 - Polish:**
- Color/spacing/typography/interaction audits
- Final consistency pass

   - ✅ Mobile menu works
   - ✅ All content preserved

2. **http://localhost:4001/forge**
   - ✅ Same layout as dashboard
   - ✅ Consistent navigation

3. **http://localhost:4001/programs**
   - ✅ Professional redesign
   - ✅ Same navigation
   - ✅ Search & filter work
   - ✅ Beautiful program cards
   - ✅ Stats dashboard

4. **http://localhost:4001/goals**
   - ⚠️ Old design (needs update)
   - Still functional

## 💡 Decisions Needed

**Should we:**

1. **Complete the goals page redesign now?**
   - Pro: Finish Phase 2 completely
   - Pro: Maintain momentum
   - Con: Need careful file replacement

2. **Move to progress/achievements pages instead?**
   - Pro: Easier fresh start
   - Pro: See more variety in designs
   - Con: Leave Phase 2 incomplete

3. **Start Phase 4 cleanup?**
   - Pro: Remove confusion from dual layouts
   - Pro: Cleaner codebase
   - Con: Still have inconsistent pages

**My Recommendation:**
Let's move forward with either **progress** or **achievements** page next. These will be easier fresh starts, and we can return to goals later with lessons learned.
