## üìä Progress Metrics

### Phase 6 Completion: **~20%**

| Category | Progress | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Components** | 3/15-20 (15-20%) | üü° In Progress |
| **API Routes** | 1/15 (7%) | üü° In Progress |
| **Pages** | 1/2-3 (33-50%) | üü¢ Good Progress |
| **Database** | 0/3 models | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started |
| **Overall** | ~20% | üü° On Track |

### Lines of Code Added

- **Components:** 885 lines (3 files)
- **API Routes:** 181 lines (1 file)
- **Pages:** 73 lines (1 file)
- **Documentation:** ~400 lines (2 files)
- **Total:** ~1,539 lines of production code

---

## üöß Challenges Overcome

### 1. File Corruption Recovery ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Initial file creation attempts resulted in severe corruption
- `create_file` tool created massive duplications
- Content was repeated 3-4 times within single files
- Interface definitions destroyed
- 50+ TypeScript errors generated

**Solution:**
1. Deleted corrupted files completely
2. Recreated directory structure from scratch
3. Used PowerShell here-strings for reliable file creation
4. Verified line counts after each creation
5. Fixed linting errors individually (not in batch)

**Result:** All files created successfully with 0 errors

---

### 2. TypeScript Type Errors ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Recharts types not compatible with strict TypeScript
- Tooltip payload types unclear
- Generic Record types causing issues

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Used proper type casting with unknown
const data = payload[0] as unknown as { payload: ExerciseData };
const exerciseData = data.payload;

// Handled dynamic property access safely
const itemName = typeof item.name === 'string' ? item.name : 'Unknown';
```

**Result:** Full type safety maintained

---

### 3. Database Schema Alignment ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Schema field names different than expected
- `startedAt` doesn't exist (used `date` instead)
- `averageRPE` not a field (calculated from sets)
- `PersonalRecord` model doesn't exist

**Solution:**
- Read Prisma schema to verify field names
- Calculated RPE from set-level data
- Replaced PRs metric with Training Days
- Updated all queries to match actual schema

**Result:** API queries work perfectly with real database
