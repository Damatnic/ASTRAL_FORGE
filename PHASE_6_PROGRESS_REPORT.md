---

### 3. **API Routes Created** (1/15)

#### Analytics Overview API ✅
- **File:** `app/api/analytics/overview/route.ts`
- **Lines:** 181 lines
- **Method:** GET
- **Authentication:** NextAuth session required

**Request Parameters:**
- `period` (query param): `'7d' | '30d' | '90d' | '1y' | 'all'`

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  metrics: Array<{
    label: string;
    value: string | number;
    change: number;
    trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
    color: string;
  }>;
  period: string;
  dateRange: {
    start: string; // ISO date
    end: string;   // ISO date
  };
}
```

**Calculations:**
1. **Total Volume:**
   - Sum of (weight × reps) for all sets
   - Comparison with previous period
   - Percentage change calculation

2. **Workouts Completed:**
   - Count of completed sessions
   - Period-over-period comparison

3. **Average Intensity (RPE):**
   - Average of all set RPE values
   - Lower RPE trend = better (recovery consideration)

4. **Training Days:**
   - Count of unique training days
   - Frequency tracking

**Database Queries:**
- Fetch WorkoutSessions with date range filtering
- Include all sets for volume calculation
- Optimized with indexes on `userId` and `date`

**Error Handling:**
- 401 Unauthorized (no session)
- 404 User not found
- 500 Internal server error with logging

---

## 🏗️ Technical Details

### Database Schema Used
- **WorkoutSession:** Main session data (date, completed, duration)
- **SetEntry:** Individual set data (weight, reps, RPE)
- **User:** User authentication and profile

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript type definitions
- Prisma type generation
- Interface definitions for all data structures

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient date range queries
- Single database roundtrip per period
- Indexed queries on frequently accessed fields

## 🔄 File Corruption Recovery

### Issue Encountered
During initial component creation, the `progress-overview.tsx` file became corrupted due to:
- `multi_replace_string_in_file` tool matching wrong content
- Multiple duplications in file creation
- Interference between create_file tool and file system

### Resolution Steps
1. ❌ Attempted create_file → Resulted in duplicated content
2. ❌ Attempted multi_replace fixes → Destroyed interface definitions
3. ✅ Deleted corrupted file and directory
4. ✅ Recreated directory from scratch
5. ✅ Used PowerShell direct file creation with here-string (`@'...'@`)
6. ✅ Verified correct line count (235 lines)
7. ✅ Build successful with no errors

### Lessons Learned
- `multi_replace_string_in_file` dangerous with non-unique strings
- PowerShell here-strings more reliable for large file creation
- Always verify line count after file creation
- Fix linting errors one at a time, not in batch

3. `/api/analytics/consistency-score` - Training frequency metrics
4. `/api/analytics/predictions` - AI-powered performance predictions

### Step 3: Analytics Dashboard Page (30 mins)

## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### Smart Trend Detection
```typescript
const getTrend = (change: number): 'up' | 'down' | 'stable' => {
  if (change > 2) return 'up';
  if (change < -2) return 'down';
  return 'stable';
};
```
