Hooks               | 25%             | 70%+   ⚠️
Utils               | 60%             | 70%+   ⚠️
--------------------|-----------------|-------
Overall             | ~50%            | 70%+   ⚠️
```

### High-Priority Coverage Gaps
1. **Analytics API Routes** (10 routes, minimal coverage)
2. **New Analytics Components** (11 components, no tests yet)
3. **Custom Hooks** (data fetching, queries)
4. **Integration Tests** (API → Component flow)

5. **96.6% overall test pass rate** (201/208 tests)
6. **Jest infrastructure solid** (config, setup, mocking)

### 📚 Test Quality Highlights
- **Comprehensive coverage** of core analytics algorithms

## 🎓 Testing Patterns Established

### Test Organization
```typescript
describe('Feature Area', () => {
  describe('Specific Function/Component', () => {
    test('should handle normal case', () => { ... })
    test('should handle edge case', () => { ... })
    test('should handle error case', () => { ... })
  })
})
```

### Algorithm Testing Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Define inputs
const input = createMockData(...)

// 2. Calculate expected output
const expected = algorithm(input)

// 3. Assert correctness
expect(expected).toBe(value)
expect(expected).toBeGreaterThan(threshold)
```

### Data-Driven Tests
```typescript
// Use realistic mock data
const createMockWorkout = (date, volume, exercises) => ({ ... })
const createMockExerciseLog = (name, weight, reps) => ({ ... })

// Test with multiple scenarios
const scenarios = [
  { input: ..., expected: ... },
  { input: ..., expected: ... },
]
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Worked Well
1. **Algorithm isolation** - Testing pure calculation functions first
2. **Mock data helpers** - Reusable test data generators
3. **Comprehensive edge cases** - Zero values, extreme ratios, plateaus
4. **Clear test names** - Descriptive test descriptions
5. **Node environment for APIs** - Avoiding browser-specific issues

### ⚠️ Challenges Encountered
1. **Component test failures** - Pre-existing accessibility issues
2. **Environment setup** - window/matchMedia mocking for node tests
3. **Multiple elements** - Button selectors with duplicate text
4. **Test isolation** - Some tests affecting global state

### 🔧 Solutions Applied
1. Added environment check for `window` mocking
2. Used specific test environment pragmas (`@jest-environment node`)
3. Fixed edge case boundary issues (>15% vs >=15%)
4. Prefixed unused helpers with `_` to satisfy linter
