**API:** `app/api/analytics/ai-insights/route.ts` (470 lines)

**Advanced AI Algorithms:**

**1. Consistency Analysis**
```typescript
const score = Math.min(100, (daysWithWorkouts / 30) * 100 * 3.33);
// 3 workouts/week = 100 score
// Generates insights for <6 workouts (low) or >12 workouts (excellent)
```

**2. Volume Trend Analysis**
```typescript
const recentVolume = recent5.reduce((sum, w) => sum + volume(w), 0);
const previousVolume = previous5.reduce((sum, w) => sum + volume(w), 0);
const change = ((recentVolume - previousVolume) / previousVolume) * 100;
// >15% = increasing trend, <-15% = decreasing trend
```

**3. Muscle Group Balance**
```typescript
// Push:Pull ratio analysis
const ratio = pushSets / pullSets;
if (ratio > 1.5 || ratio < 0.67) {
  // Generate imbalance warning
}

// Leg:Upper ratio analysis
const legRatio = legs / (push + pull);
if (legRatio < 0.3) {
  // Generate leg training warning
}
```

**4. Progressive Overload Detection**
```typescript
exerciseMap.forEach((sets) => {
  const recentMax = Math.max(...recent5.map(s => s.weight));
  const previousMax = Math.max(...previous5.map(s => s.weight));
  
  if (recentMax > previousMax) progressingCount++;
  else if (recentMax === previousMax) stallCount++;
});

// >3 progressing = strength insight
// >5 stalling = recommendation insight
```

**5. Recovery Pattern Analysis**
```typescript
// Detect consecutive training days
let maxConsecutive = 1;
for (dates) {
  const dayDiff = (dates[i-1] - dates[i]) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  if (dayDiff <= 1.5) currentConsecutive++;
}

if (maxConsecutive >= 7) {
  // Generate overtraining warning
}
```

**6. Exercise Variety Scoring**
```typescript
const uniqueExercises = new Set(sets.map(s => s.exercise.id)).size;
const score = Math.min(100, uniqueExercises * 5);

// <10 exercises = limited variety warning
// >30 exercises = excellent variety strength
```

**7. Plateau Detection**
```typescript
const recentAvg = recent5.reduce((sum, w) => sum + volume(w), 0) / 5;
const previousAvg = previous5.reduce((sum, w) => sum + volume(w), 0) / 5;
const change = Math.abs((recentAvg - previousAvg) / previousAvg) * 100;

if (change < 5) {
  // Generate plateau warning
}
```

**8. Composite Score Calculation**
```typescript
function calculateOverallScore(scores: {
  consistency: number,
  volume: number,
  balance: number,
  overload: number,
  recovery: number,
  variety: number
}): number {
  const values = Object.values(scores);
  const avg = values.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / values.length;
  return Math.round(Math.min(100, Math.max(0, avg)));
}
```

**Insight Structure:**
```typescript
interface Insight {
  id: string;
  type: "strength" | "weakness" | "recommendation" | "achievement" | "warning" | "opportunity";
  category: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  actionable: boolean;
  action?: string;  // Specific recommendation
}
```

**Example Insights Generated:**

**Strength:**
- "Excellent Training Consistency" - 12+ workouts/month
- "Multiple Exercises Progressing" - 3+ exercises with weight increases
- "Excellent Exercise Variety" - 30+ unique exercises

**Weakness:**
- "Inconsistent Training Frequency" - <6 workouts/month
- "Undertraining Lower Body" - Legs <30% of upper body volume
- "Limited Exercise Variety" - <10 unique exercises

**Warning:**
- "Push/Pull Imbalance Detected" - Ratio >1.5:1 or <0.67:1
- "Potential Overtraining Detected" - 7+ consecutive training days
- "Training Plateau Detected" - <5% volume change over time
- "Decreasing Training Volume" - >15% volume decrease

**Recommendation:**
- "Some Exercises Have Stalled" - 5+ exercises with no weight progress
- Actionable: "Try: deload week, change rep ranges, add volume"

**Opportunity:**
- "Limited Exercise Variety" - Potential to add new exercises
- Actionable: "Explore new exercises to target muscles from different angles"

## 🧮 Advanced Algorithms Implemented

### Mathematical Formulas

**1. TSS (Training Stress Score)**
```typescript
TSS = (duration × intensity²) / 3600
```

**2. TRIMP (Training Impulse)**
```typescript
TRIMP = duration × intensity_factor × 10
```

**3. ACR (Acute:Chronic Ratio)**
```typescript
ACR = 7-day average / 28-day average
Optimal: 0.8-1.3
Risk: >1.5 or <0.8
```

**4. HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**
```typescript
HRV = baseline + (sleep - 7) × 3 - (soreness - 2) × 2
```

**5. Recovery Composite Score**
```typescript
Score = Sleep(40%) + HRV(30%) + InverseSoreness(30%)
```

**6. Estimated 1RM (Epley Formula)**
```typescript
1RM = weight × (1 + reps / 30)
```

**7. Linear Regression (Least Squares)**
```typescript
slope = (n × Σ(xy) - Σx × Σy) / (n × Σ(x²) - (Σx)²)
intercept = (Σy - slope × Σx) / n
```

**8. ISO Week Boundaries**
```typescript
const daysToMonday = currentDayOfWeek === 0 ? 6 : currentDayOfWeek - 1;
weekStart.setDate(now.getDate() - daysToMonday + (weekOffset * 7));
```

**9. Variance Calculation**
```typescript
variance = Σ((x - mean)²) / n
```

**10. Composite Scoring**
```typescript
overallScore = (Σ individual_scores) / n
Normalized to 0-100 range
```
