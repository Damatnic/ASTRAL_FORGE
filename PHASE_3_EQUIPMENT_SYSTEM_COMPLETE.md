   - Account for both sides of bar
   - Minimize plate count
   ```

2. **ROI Scoring**
   ```typescript
   // Multi-factor equipment value assessment
   - Goal alignment (30%)
   - Exercise unlocks (25%)
   - Template unlocks (20%)
   - Budget fit (15%)
   - Space requirements (10%)
   - Returns 0-100 score
   ```

3. **Equipment Filtering**
   ```typescript
   // Smart exercise availability checking
   - Required equipment validation
   - Alternative exercise mapping
   - Partial equipment handling
   - Category-based substitutions
   ```

### Data Structures

1. **Equipment Item**
   ```typescript
   {
     id, name, category, cost,
     requiredEquipment, alternatives,
     spaceRequired, description
   }
   ```

2. **Plate Inventory**
   ```typescript
   {
     weight, quantity, location,
     unit (kg/lb)
   }
   ```

3. **Equipment Recommendation**
   ```typescript
   {
     equipmentName, category, priority,
     reasoning, benefits, estimatedCost,
     unlocks (exercises/templates), roi
   }
   ```

4. **Workout Template**
   ```typescript
   {
     name, description, requiredEquipment,
