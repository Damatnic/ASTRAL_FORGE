## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Systematic Deletion Strategy

**Approach:**
1. Identify all gaming files (components + pages)
2. Delete components with no dependencies first
3. Delete pages that import components
4. Delete remaining components
5. Update navigation last

**Result:** Zero broken imports, clean build every step

### 2. Gaming vs. Fitness Separation

**Keep (Fitness-Related):**
- Achievements (fitness milestones)
- Challenges (fitness competitions)
- Social features (friend workouts)
- Progress tracking
- Analytics

**Remove (Pure Gaming):**
- RPG mechanics (levels, tiers, prestige)
- Fantasy elements (bosses, pets, crafting, dungeons)
- Guild systems
- Character progression
- PvP battles

**Lesson:** Clear distinction enables professional fitness app identity

### 3. Navigation Consolidation

**Pattern:**
- Combine related features (Settings → Profile)
- Use clear terminology (Forge → Dashboard)
- Focus on core workflows (Training, Progress, Tools)
- Limit top-level sections (7 max for sidebar)

**Impact:** Cleaner UX, easier navigation, professional appearance

### 4. Incremental Verification

**Strategy:**
- Build after each major deletion
- Test navigation after updates
- Verify no broken links
- Check bundle size regularly

**Benefit:** Catch issues early, maintain working state
