### Data Flow
```
Dashboard Page
├── Fetches stats from /api/stats
├── Falls back to mock data if API unavailable
├── Passes stats to components:
│   ├── DashboardHeader (level, streak)
│   ├── XPProgressBar (currentXP, requiredXP, level)
│   └── StreakTracker (currentStreak, longestStreak)
└── Renders navigation grid (unchanged)
```
