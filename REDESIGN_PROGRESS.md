## Notes

### What Was Accomplished
- âœ… **Build is successful** - No broken imports or TypeScript errors
- âœ… **30+ files deleted** - Removed all major gaming systems

### Git History
- All deleted files are stored in git history if rollback is needed

### Next Session Recommendations
1. **Complete Phase 1 Low Priority** - Remove remaining gaming icons
2. **Begin Phase 2** - Start Dashboard Redesign with unified layout
3. **Or skip to Phase 3** - Begin Equipment System implementation

### Technical Debt
- Some lint warnings remain (TypeScript `any` types, unused variables)
- `app/forge/page.tsx` needs further cleanup
- `components/title-badge-system.tsx` may have prestige references
- Library files still exist: `lib/quest-system.ts`, `lib/skill-tree-system.ts`, `lib/rpg-stats-system.ts`
  - These can be deleted or refactored for new systems
