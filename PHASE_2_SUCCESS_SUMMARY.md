## Developer Notes

### API Integration Points
The dashboard expects these endpoints:
- `/api/user` - User profile data
- `/api/programs/active` - Active training program
- `/api/stats` - User statistics (streak, volume, PRs)
- `/api/achievements?limit=3` - Recent achievements

### State Management
Clean React hooks pattern:
```typescript
const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null)
const [program, setProgram] = useState<any>(null)
const [stats, setStats] = useState<any>(null)
const [achievements, setAchievements] = useState<any[]>([])
const [socialFeed, setSocialFeed] = useState<any[]>([])
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
mobile: < 768px
tablet: 768px - 1024px
desktop: > 1024px
```
