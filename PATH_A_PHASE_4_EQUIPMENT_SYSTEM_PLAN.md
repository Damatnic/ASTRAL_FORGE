## üìã Session Breakdown

### Session 1: Database Schema & API Foundation (1 hour)
**Status:** üîÑ CURRENT

**Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Create plan document
2. ‚è≥ Design Equipment model in Prisma schema
3. ‚è≥ Create user_equipment junction table
4. ‚è≥ Add equipment field to Exercise model
5. ‚è≥ Run database migrations
6. ‚è≥ Create /api/equipment endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
7. ‚è≥ Test API with sample data

**Database Schema:**
```prisma
model Equipment {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String   @unique
  category    String   // Barbell, Dumbbell, Machine, Bodyweight, etc.
  icon        String?  // Icon name for UI
  description String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Relations
  userEquipment UserEquipment[]
  exercises     Exercise[]      @relation("ExerciseEquipment")
}

model UserEquipment {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  equipmentId String
  location    String   // "home" | "gym" | "travel"
  quantity    Int      @default(1)
  notes       String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  user      User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  equipment Equipment @relation(fields: [equipmentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@unique([userId, equipmentId, location])
  @@index([userId])
}

// Update Exercise model to add equipment relation
model Exercise {
  // ... existing fields ...
  requiredEquipment Equipment[] @relation("ExerciseEquipment")
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/equipment` - List all equipment types
- `GET /api/equipment/user` - Get user's equipment
- `POST /api/equipment/user` - Add equipment to user inventory
- `PUT /api/equipment/user/:id` - Update user equipment
- `DELETE /api/equipment/user/:id` - Remove equipment from inventory

**Deliverables:**
- Updated Prisma schema
- Database migration files
- 5 API endpoints tested and working
- Seed data for common equipment types

4. ‚è≥ Build equipment category filters
5. ‚è≥ Add location tabs (Home / Gym / Travel)
6. ‚è≥ Implement equipment CRUD UI flows
7. ‚è≥ Add empty states and loading states

**UI Components:**
- EquipmentCard - Display equipment with quantity/location
