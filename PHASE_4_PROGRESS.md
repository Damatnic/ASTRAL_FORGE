## ‚úÖ Task 1: Achievement Tiers System - COMPLETE

### Files Created:

1. **`lib/training-tiers.ts`** (~430 lines)
   - Tier system replacing XP/Levels
   - 6 tiers: Novice ‚Üí Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Elite ‚Üí Master
   - Real strength criteria (bodyweight multipliers)
   - Tier calculation algorithm
   - Progress tracking to next tier
   - Personalized recommendations

2. **`components/tier-progress-card.tsx`**
   - Visual tier display component
   - Progress bar to next tier
   - Current tier benefits list
   - Recommended next steps
   - Replaces level-progress-card.tsx

### Tier System Design:

**Novice** (üå± 0-3 months)
- Just starting, no strength requirements
- Focus: Learning form, building habits

**Beginner** (üî∞ 3-12 months)
- Requirements: 0.75x bench, 1x squat, 1.25x deadlift
- 70% consistency, 36+ workouts
- Focus: Linear progression

**Intermediate** (‚ö° 1-3 years)
- Requirements: 1x bench, 1.5x squat, 2x deadlift, 4.5x total
- 75% consistency, 150+ workouts
- Focus: Periodization

**Advanced** (üî• 3-5 years)
- Requirements: 1.5x bench, 2x squat, 2.5x deadlift, 6x total
- 80% consistency, 400+ workouts
- Focus: Competition prep

**Elite** (üíé 5-10 years)
- Requirements: 1.75x bench, 2.25x squat, 2.75x deadlift, 6.75x total
- 85% consistency, 800+ workouts
- Focus: Competitive standards

- 90% consistency, 1500+ workouts
- Focus: Coaching/mentorship

### Tier Calculation Algorithm:

```typescript
calculateUserTier(stats)
```

**Inputs:**
- Bodyweight (kg)
- 1RM values (bench/squat/deadlift)
- Total workouts completed
- Training months
- Consistency rate (0-100%)
- Current streak (optional)

**Outputs:**
- Current tier
- Progress to next tier (0-100%)
- Met criteria
- Unmet criteria (what's blocking advancement)
- Personalized recommendations

**Logic:**
1. Calculate strength ratios (1RM / bodyweight)
2. Check tiers from highest to lowest
3. Match first tier where ALL criteria are met
4. Track progress toward next tier
5. Generate specific recommendations

### Features:

‚úÖ **Objective Progression:** Based on real performance
‚úÖ **Multiple Criteria:** Strength + consistency + time
‚úÖ **Personalized Feedback:** Specific improvement targets
‚úÖ **Visual Progress:** Beautiful tier badges with gradients
‚úÖ **Motivational:** Clear path to next tier
