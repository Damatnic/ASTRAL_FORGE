## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### Equipment-Based Filtering
```typescript
filterTemplatesByEquipment(templates, userEquipment) → {
  available,    // Can start immediately
  partial,      // Some equipment missing but workable
  unavailable   // Missing critical equipment
}
```

### Template Matching Algorithm
1. Check if user has ALL required equipment → Available
2. Check if user has SOME required equipment → Partial
3. Otherwise → Unavailable

### Smart Alternative Exercises
Each exercise in templates includes alternatives:
```typescript
{
  exerciseName: "Bench Press",
  requiredEquipment: ["barbell", "bench"],
  alternatives: [
    { exerciseName: "Dumbbell Bench Press", requiredEquipment: ["dumbbell", "bench"] },
    { exerciseName: "Push-Up", requiredEquipment: ["bodyweight"] }
  ]
}
```
