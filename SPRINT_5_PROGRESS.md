## üí° Educational Content

### How to Choose a Program

**If you're brand new** (0-3 months):
- Start with **StrongLifts 5√ó5** or **Starting Strength**
- Focus on learning proper form
- Keep it simple - 3 days per week
- Linear progression works great for beginners

**If you have some experience** (3-12 months):
- Try **PPL** if you can train 6 days
- Try **Upper/Lower** if you train 4 days
- Try **GZCLP** if you want structure
- More volume = more muscle growth

**If you're experienced** (1+ year):
- Consider **5/3/1** for long-term progress
- Try **nSuns** if you can handle high volume
- Try **Texas Method** for weekly progression
- Periodization becomes important

### Program Hopping Warning
‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't switch programs too often!**
- Stick with a program for at least 8-12 weeks
- Master the movements before switching
- Progressive overload takes time
- Trust the process
