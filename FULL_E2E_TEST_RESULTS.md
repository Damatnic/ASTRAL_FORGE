## 🐛 Critical Issues (P0) - MUST FIX

### BUG-P0-004: Playwright Selector Syntax Errors

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL  
**Affected Tests:** 12 failures  
**Impact:** Blocks 12 tests from running

**Root Cause:**  
Invalid Playwright selector syntax - mixing regex text with CSS selectors

**Examples:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Can't mix text regex with CSS in single locator
page.locator('text=/analytics/i, a[href*="analytics"]')

// ❌ WRONG - Invalid CSS escaping
page.locator('a[href*="settings"], text=/settings/i')

// ✅ CORRECT - Separate or use proper syntax
page.locator('a[href*="analytics"]')
// OR
page.locator('text=/analytics/i')
```

**Failing Tests:**
1. ❌ analytics › should navigate to analytics page
2. ❌ analytics › should navigate to detailed exercise stats
3. ❌ navigation › should navigate to all main sections
4. ❌ navigation › should navigate to settings
5. ❌ navigation › should navigate to social/sharing page
6. ❌ navigation › should track goal progress
7. ❌ workout › should be able to add exercises
8. ❌ workout › should be able to add workout notes
9. ❌ workout › should save workout data
10. ❌ workout › should handle rest timer functionality

**Fix Strategy:**
- Replace mixed selectors with single-type locators
- Use CSS selectors (more stable): `a[href*="path"]`
- Or use text alone: `text=/pattern/i`
- Never combine both in single locator

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes

### BUG-P0-005: Authentication Login Broken

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL  
**Affected Tests:** 4 failures  
**Impact:** Core authentication flow broken

**Issue:**  
Login with demo credentials not redirecting to `/forge`

**Error:**
```
Expected URL: /.*\/forge/
Actual URL: http://localhost:4001/auth/signin
```

**Failing Tests:**
1. ❌ auth › should successfully login with demo credentials
2. ❌ auth › should be able to logout after login
3. ❌ auth › should persist session after page reload
4. ❌ auth › should navigate to login page (homepage button)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Dev server restart broke something
2. Session/cookie issue
3. NextAuth configuration changed
4. Frontend form submission issue

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Test login manually in browser
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify NextAuth API route working
4. Check signin page form submission
5. Verify session creation

**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours (investigation needed)
