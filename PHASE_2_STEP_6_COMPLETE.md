## 🧮 Recommendation Algorithm

### Scoring System

```typescript
function getRecommendedPrograms(
  programs: typeof mockPrograms,
  userLevel: string = 'Intermediate',
  userGoals: string[] = ['Muscle Hypertrophy']
) {
  const scoredPrograms = programs.map(program => {
    let score = 0
    
    // 1. Difficulty Matching (50 points max)
    if (program.difficulty === userLevel) score += 50
    else if (userLevel === 'Beginner' && program.difficulty === 'Intermediate') score += 20
    else if (userLevel === 'Intermediate' && program.difficulty === 'Advanced') score += 20
    else if (userLevel === 'Advanced' && program.difficulty === 'Intermediate') score += 15
    
    // 2. Popularity (24.5 points max at 4.9 rating)
    score += program.popularity * 5
    
    // 3. Goal Alignment (30 points per matching goal)
    if (userGoals.includes('Muscle Hypertrophy') && program.category === 'Hypertrophy') score += 30
    if (userGoals.includes('Strength Gains') && 
       (program.category === 'Strength' || program.category === 'Powerlifting')) score += 30
    if (userGoals.includes('Athletic Performance') && program.category === 'Athletic') score += 30
    
    // 4. Frequency Preference (15 points)
    if (program.daysPerWeek >= 3 && program.daysPerWeek <= 5) score += 15
    
    // 5. Exclusions (0 points = excluded)
    if (program.isActive || program.category === 'Custom') score = 0
    
    return { ...program, recommendationScore: score }
  })
  
  // Sort and return top 3
  return scoredPrograms
    .filter(p => p.recommendationScore > 0)
    .sort((a, b) => b.recommendationScore - a.recommendationScore)
    .slice(0, 3)
}
```

### Scoring Breakdown

| Factor | Weight | Max Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Difficulty Match** | Highest | 50 | Most critical for safety & effectiveness |
| **Exact Match** | - | 50 | User's current level |
| **Adjacent Level** | - | 15-20 | Progressive challenge |
| **Popularity** | High | ~25 | Community validation |
| **Rating Multiplier** | - | rating × 5 | 4.9 rating = 24.5 points |
| **Goal Alignment** | High | 30/goal | Direct goal support |
| **Hypertrophy Match** | - | 30 | For muscle growth goal |
| **Strength Match** | - | 30 | For strength/powerlifting goal |
| **Athletic Match** | - | 30 | For athletic performance goal |
| **Frequency** | Medium | 15 | Sustainable schedule |
| **Optimal Range** | - | 15 | 3-5 days/week sweet spot |

**Total Possible Score:** ~125 points (with multiple goal matches)

## 🔧 User Data Integration

### Current Implementation (Mock Data)

```typescript
const recommendedPrograms = getRecommendedPrograms(
  mockPrograms,
  'Intermediate',              // Hardcoded for demo
  ['Muscle Hypertrophy', 'Strength Gains']  // Hardcoded for demo
)
```

### Production Integration Path

**Step 1: Fetch User Profile**
```typescript
const { data: userProfile } = await fetch('/api/user/profile')
const userLevel = userProfile.fitnessLevel  // 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'
const userGoals = userProfile.goals         // ['Muscle Hypertrophy', 'Strength Gains', ...]
```

**Step 2: Call Algorithm**
```typescript
const recommendedPrograms = getRecommendedPrograms(
  programs,
  userLevel,
  userGoals
)
```

**Step 3: Track Interactions**
```typescript
// Log when user clicks recommended program
analytics.track('recommendation_clicked', {
  programId: program.id,
  score: program.recommendationScore,
  reasons: getReasons(program)
})
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Top 3 Only?
- **Reduces choice paralysis**: Too many options overwhelm users
- **Maintains quality**: Only best matches shown
- **Encourages action**: Focused selection drives engagement
- **Visual balance**: 3-column grid looks clean

### Why Yellow Theme?
- **High visibility**: Yellow stands out from blue/purple theme
- **Positive association**: Yellow = recommendation, gold standard
- **Consistent with stars**: Star icon naturally pairs with yellow
- **Accessibility**: High contrast with dark background

### Why Exclude Active Programs?
- **Prevents confusion**: Don't recommend what they're already doing
- **Fresh suggestions**: Show new opportunities
- **Logical flow**: Active programs shown in separate section
- **Better experience**: Recommendations feel more valuable

### Why Multi-Factor Scoring?
- **Nuanced matching**: No single factor dominates
- **Balanced results**: Considers multiple user needs
- **Transparent**: Reasons shown explain why recommended
- **Flexible**: Easy to tune weights based on feedback
