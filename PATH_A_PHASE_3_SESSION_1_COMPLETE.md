## 📊 XP System Implementation

### Current (Mock Data)
```typescript
{
  totalWorkouts: 127,      // 127 workouts completed
  currentXP: 8450,         // XP earned from workouts + achievements
  requiredXP: 10000,       // Level 42 → 43 threshold
  level: 42,               // Math.floor(8450 / 1000) + adjustments
  currentStreak: 12,       // 12 consecutive days
  totalVolume: 125000,     // 125,000 kg total lifted
  personalRecords: 8       // 8 PRs this month
}
```

### XP Calculation Formula
```typescript
// XP earned per action
- Workout completed: +100 XP
- Personal record: +500 XP
- Streak milestone (10 days): +250 XP
- Achievement unlocked: +300 XP

// Level calculation
Level = Math.floor(totalXP / 1000) + 1
Next Level XP = currentLevel × 1000

// Current example:
Level 42 = 42,000+ total XP earned
Current: 8,450 XP into Level 42
Needed: 10,000 XP to hit Level 43
Remaining: 1,550 XP
```
