## 🎯 Boss Battle Mechanics

### Health Bar System
- **Initial Health**: 100 HP for all bosses
- **Damage Mechanism**: Performance progress depletes boss health
- **Victory Condition**: Reduce boss HP to 0% by hitting target performance
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded health bar (green → yellow → orange → red)

### Phase Transitions
Each boss has 4 phases triggered by health thresholds:
- **Phase 1 (100% HP)**: Starting phase, strategy setting
- **Phase 2 (75% HP)**: Difficulty increases, first modifier
- **Phase 3 (50% HP)**: Mental challenge intensifies
- **Phase 4 (25% HP)**: Final push, maximum effort required

Example phases (Titan of the Squat Rack):
1. "Depth Check" - Hit proper depth on every rep
2. "The Grind" - Your quads are burning
3. "Mental War" - This is where champions are forged
4. "Ascension" - Leave nothing in the tank!

### Enrage Timers
Time limits for certain bosses:
- **Strength Titans**: 15-20 minutes (technique focus)
- **Circuit Demons**: 4-10 minutes (high intensity)
- **Endurance Dragons**: 20-60 minutes (long tests)
- **Hybrid Monsters**: 15-40 minutes (varied)

Exceeding enrage timer = automatic defeat

### Performance Tracking
- **Input Field**: Enter reps, weight, time, or rounds
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of target completion
- **Damage Meter**: Shows how much HP depleted
- **Real-Time Updates**: Health bar updates as you input performance

---

- **Titles**: Exclusive titles (e.g., "Murph Legend", "Fran Conqueror")

  leaderboardPoints: number;
}

interface BossAttempt {
  bossId: string;
  date: string;
  performance: number;
  victory: boolean;
  damageDealt: number;
}
```

### Component Props

```typescript
interface BossBattlesProps {
  bosses: Boss[];
  attempts: BossAttempt[];
  userLevel: number;
  onStartBattle: (bossId: string) => void;
  onCompleteBattle: (bossId: string, performance: number, victory: boolean) => void;
}
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [selectedBoss, setSelectedBoss] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [activeBoss, setActiveBoss] = useState<Boss | null>(null);
const [bossHealth, setBossHealth] = useState<number>(100);
const [currentPhase, setCurrentPhase] = useState<number>(0);
const [performance, setPerformance] = useState<string>('');
const [filterType, setFilterType] = useState<string>('all');
const [filterDifficulty, setFilterDifficulty] = useState<string>('all');
```

### Health Calculation Logic

```typescript
const handleUpdatePerformance = () => {
  const performanceValue = parseFloat(performance);
  if (!performanceValue || !activeBoss) return;

  const targetPerformance = activeBoss.workout.targetPerformance;
  const progressPercent = (performanceValue / targetPerformance) * 100;
  const newHealth = Math.max(0, 100 - progressPercent);
  setBossHealth(newHealth);

  // Check phase transitions
  if (newHealth <= 75 && currentPhase === 0) setCurrentPhase(1);
  if (newHealth <= 50 && currentPhase === 1) setCurrentPhase(2);
  if (newHealth <= 25 && currentPhase === 2) setCurrentPhase(3);

  // Check victory
  if (newHealth === 0) {
    onCompleteBattle(activeBoss.id, performanceValue, true);
    alert(`🎉 BOSS DEFEATED! You earned ${activeBoss.rewards.xp} XP!`);
    setActiveBoss(null);
    setSelectedBoss(null);
  }
};
```

### Filter System

```typescript
const filteredBosses = bosses.filter(boss => {
  const typeMatch = filterType === 'all' || boss.type === filterType;
  const difficultyMatch = filterDifficulty === 'all' || boss.difficulty === filterDifficulty;
  return typeMatch && difficultyMatch;
});
```

### API Endpoints (Next Steps)

```typescript
// GET /api/bosses - Fetch all bosses
// GET /api/bosses/[id] - Fetch specific boss
// POST /api/bosses/[id]/attempt - Start boss battle
// PUT /api/bosses/[id]/attempt - Update performance
// POST /api/bosses/[id]/complete - Complete battle
// GET /api/bosses/[id]/leaderboard - Boss-specific rankings
// GET /api/bosses/attempts - User's attempt history
```

### Leaderboard Integration

```typescript
// Boss-specific leaderboards
interface BossLeaderboardEntry {
  userId: string;
  username: string;
  performance: number;
  timeSpent: number;
  completedAt: Date;
  rank: number;
}

// Categories for rankings:
// - Fastest completion time
// - Highest performance (for strength bosses)
// - Most total victories
// - First-time victories
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

### Phase 1: Backend Integration
1. Create Prisma models for bosses and attempts
2. Build API routes for battle CRUD operations
3. Implement attempt history tracking
4. Set up boss-specific leaderboards
5. Add user level gating enforcement

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Add boss rotation system (daily/weekly featured bosses)
2. Implement special event bosses (holidays, challenges)
3. Create boss "enraged" modes for extra difficulty
4. Add co-op boss battles (team attempts)
5. Introduce boss scaling based on user level

### Phase 3: Advanced Mechanics
1. Boss "loot tables" with rare reward chances
2. Achievement system for boss-related feats
3. Boss battle replays/history
4. Training mode (practice without recording)
5. Boss unlock progression system
