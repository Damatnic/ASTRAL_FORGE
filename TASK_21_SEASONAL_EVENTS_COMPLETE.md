## 🎨 Visual Design Highlights

### Theme System
Each event theme has:
- **Primary Color**: Main accent (orange, blue, green, etc.)
- **Secondary Color**: Gradient end (yellow, cyan, emerald, etc.)
- **Gradient**: `from-{primary} to-{secondary}`
- **Background**: Transparent gradient overlays

### Color Psychology
- **Summer (Orange/Yellow)**: Energy, warmth, activity
- **Winter (Blue/Cyan)**: Cool, calm, focused strength
- **Spring (Green/Emerald)**: Growth, renewal, freshness
- **Fall (Red/Orange)**: Intensity, harvest, power
- **New Year (Purple/Pink)**: New beginnings, celebration

### Animation Details
- **Progress Bars**: Smooth width transitions (500ms)
- **Hover Effects**: Scale(1.02-1.05) on cards

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile** (<768px): Single column layout, compact cards

### Mobile Optimizations
- Stack statistics cards vertically
- Simplify leaderboard table (hide guild column)
- Compact event cards show less detail
- Tab navigation uses icons + text (becomes icon-only on small screens)
