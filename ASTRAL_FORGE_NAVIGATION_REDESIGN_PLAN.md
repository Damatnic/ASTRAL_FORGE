# 🔨 ASTRAL FORGE - Complete Navigation & Dashboard Redesign Plan

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current Problems:**
- Navigation chaos: 63 pages across complex nested folders
- Gaming elements are gimmicky (pets, marketplace, inventory with fake items)
- Character sheet is over-the-top RPG nonsense 
- No unified dashboard - users have to click through endless pages
- Equipment/inventory is fantasy items instead of real gym equipment
- Skill trees don't make practical sense for fitness

**Solution:**
- Streamlined 3-tier navigation system
- Replace gimmicky features with practical fitness tools
- Unified forge dashboard as central hub
- Equipment inventory for real gym gear
- Simplified progression that makes sense
- Complete elimination of gaming bullshit
