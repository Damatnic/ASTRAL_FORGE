**useMemo for expensive calculations**:
1. `mockMeasurements`: 90 days of generated data
2. `mockPhotos`: 36 progress photos
3. `stats`: Current stats, changes, and goals
4. `chartData`: Filtered data for selected metric
5. `photosByDate`: Grouped and sorted photos

### Helper Functions
1. **formatDate**: Convert ISO date to MM/DD format
2. **getMetricLabel**: Get display label with unit for metric
3. **togglePhotoSelection**: Add/remove photos from comparison (max 4)

### TypeScript Types
```typescript
type MeasurementType = 'weight' | 'bodyFat' | 'muscleMass' | 'bmi' | 'waist' | 'chest';

interface Measurement {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  weight: number;
  bodyFat?: number;
