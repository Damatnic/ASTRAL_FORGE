**Path A Overall:** ~30% Complete (4.75 hours / 15-19 hours)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Clean Deletion Strategy
**Approach:**
1. Delete components with no dependencies first
2. Delete pages that import components
3. Delete remaining components (dependencies gone)
4. Update navigation last (after deletions complete)

**Result:** Zero broken imports, clean build

### 2. Navigation Simplification
**Pattern:**
- Consolidate related settings (Settings → Profile)
- Use professional terminology (Forge → Dashboard)
- Focus on core features (Challenges over Compete)
- Group logically (Progress, Training, Tools)

**Impact:** Clearer UX, easier navigation

### 3. Gaming vs. Fitness Separation
**Keep:**
- Achievements (fitness milestones)
- Challenges (fitness competitions)
- Social features (friend workouts)

**Remove:**
- Pure gaming (bosses, crafting, dungeons)
- RPG mechanics (skills, prestige, levels)
- Fantasy elements (pets, guilds, world map)

**Result:** Professional fitness app identity

---

## ✅ Session 1 Sign-Off

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Quality:** ✅ HIGH (clean build, professional navigation)  
**Impact:** ✅ POSITIVE (18 files removed, cleaner UX)  
**Risk:** ✅ MINIMAL (all deletions safe, build successful)  

**Ready for:** Session 2 - Rename & Final Testing (2.5-3 hours)
