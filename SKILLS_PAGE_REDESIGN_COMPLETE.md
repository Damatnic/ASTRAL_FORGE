## Integration Points (Ready for API)

### Endpoints to Create
```typescript
// User skill stats
GET /api/skills/stats
// Returns: totalPoints, unlockedSkills, completedSkills, inProgress, nextMilestone

// All skills for user
GET /api/skills
// Returns: Array of Skill objects with progress

// Update skill progress
PUT /api/skills/:id/progress
// Body: { currentValue: number }

// Complete skill
POST /api/skills/:id/complete
// Marks skill as completed, awards points, records date

// Create custom skill
POST /api/skills/custom
// Body: Skill data for user-defined goals
```

### Database Schema Needed
```typescript
// UserSkill table
{
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  skillId: string;          // Reference to master skills
  progress: number;
  currentValue: number;
  isUnlocked: boolean;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  earnedDate: Date | null;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// MasterSkill table (seeded data)
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: SkillCategory;
  tier: SkillTier;
  points: number;
  requirement: string;
  targetValue: number;
  unlockConditions: json;   // Prerequisites
}
```

## Migration from Old System

### Old File Structure
```
app/skills/page.tsx              // Server component with MilestoneSystem
components/milestone-tracker.tsx  // Client component with filtering
lib/milestone-system.ts          // Business logic and calculations
```

### New File Structure
```
app/skills/page.tsx              // Single client component with AppLayout
app/skills/page_old_backup.tsx  // Backup of original implementation
```

### Migration Benefits
- ✅ Reduced complexity (3 files → 1 file)
- ✅ Better performance (client-side only, no server fetching)
- ✅ Unified design (matches all other pages)
- ✅ Improved UX (clearer sections, better visual hierarchy)
- ✅ More maintainable (single source of truth)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Create API endpoints** for skill data persistence
2. ✅ **Connect to database** with UserSkill and MasterSkill tables
3. ✅ **Seed master skills** from current mock data
4. ✅ **Implement progress tracking** from workout sessions
5. ✅ **Add custom skill creation** modal/form
6. ✅ **Calculate automatic unlocks** based on user achievements
7. ✅ **Add skill click handlers** for detailed view
8. ✅ **Implement sorting options** (by progress, tier, recent)
9. ✅ **Add achievements integration** to auto-unlock skills
10. ✅ **Create notification system** for newly earned skills
