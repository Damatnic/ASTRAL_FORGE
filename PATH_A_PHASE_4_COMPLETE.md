## 🔥 Technical Highlights

### Smart Filtering Algorithm
```typescript
// Only show exercises where user has ALL required equipment
const available = exercises.filter(ex => {
  const required = ex.equipmentLinks.map(el => el.equipmentId)
  if (required.length === 0) return true // Bodyweight
  return required.every(id => userEquipmentIds.includes(id))
})
```

### Multi-Relation Query
```typescript
// Efficient single query with nested includes
const exercises = await prisma.exercise.findMany({
  include: {
    equipmentLinks: {
      include: { equipment: true }
    }
  }
})
```

### Location-Based Inventory
```typescript
// Composite key for multi-location tracking
@@id([userId, equipmentId, location])
```
