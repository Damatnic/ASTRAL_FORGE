# Phase 4 Task 4: Rewards System Redesign - ✅ COMPLETE

**Started:** October 6, 2025  
**Completed:** October 6, 2025  
**Progress:** 100% ✅

---

## 🎯 Objective

Remove RNG loot mechanics and create deterministic achievement-based reward system.

---

## ✅ ALL STEPS COMPLETED

### 1. Sound System Cleanup (100%)

**File:** `lib/sound-system.ts`

**Removed:**
- ✅ `'loot'` sound type
- ✅ `'loot_common'` sound type
- ✅ `'loot_rare'` sound type
- ✅ `'loot_epic'` sound type
- ✅ `'loot_legendary'` sound type
- ✅ `playLoot()` method (~25 lines)
- ✅ `playLootRare()` method (~25 lines)
- ✅ `playLootEpic()` method (~25 lines)
- ✅ `playLootLegendary()` method (~30 lines)
- ✅ All loot switch cases in sound handler

**Kept (Repurposed):**
- `'achievement'` - For unlocking achievements
- `'achievement_rare'` - For tier advancements
- `'achievement_legendary'` - For major milestones
- `'chest_open'` - Repurposed for template unlocks
- `'gold_gained'` - Repurposed for unlock notifications

**Result:** ~105 lines of loot sound code removed, no loot references remain

---

### 2. Database Schema Update (100%)

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Added UserUnlock Model:**
```prisma
model UserUnlock {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String
  type       String   // 'template' | 'feature' | 'title'
  identifier String   // Name/ID of what was unlocked
  source     String?  // 'quest' | 'tier' | 'achievement'
  unlockedAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@unique([userId, type, identifier])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**Migration:** `20251006093421_add_user_unlocks`
- ✅ Created `user_unlocks` table
- ✅ Added relation to User model
- ✅ Unique constraint on userId + type + identifier
- ✅ Index on userId for performance

---

### 3. Achievement Unlock System (100%)

**File:** `lib/achievement-unlock-system.ts` (~470 lines)

**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ `isAchievementUnlocked()` - Check if achievement exists
- ✅ `unlockAchievement()` - Create achievement record
- ✅ `getUnlockedAchievements()` - Get all user achievements
- ✅ `isTemplateUnlocked()` - Check template access
- ✅ `unlockTemplate()` - Grant template access
- ✅ `isFeatureUnlocked()` - Check feature access
- ✅ `unlockFeature()` - Enable feature/metric
- ✅ `grantTitle()` - Award special title
- ✅ `getUserUnlocks()` - Get all unlocks with stats
- ✅ `processQuestRewards()` - Handle quest completion rewards

**Features:**
- Deterministic rewards (no RNG)
- Duplicate checking (won't unlock twice)
- Source tracking (quest/tier/achievement)
- Unified unlock interface
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Error handling with fallbacks

**Interfaces:**
- `UnlockResult` - Standard unlock response
- `UserUnlocks` - Complete unlock summary
- `Achievement` - Achievement data structure
- `Template` - Template data structure
- `Title` - Title data structure
